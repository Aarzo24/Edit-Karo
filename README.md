# Edit Karo

## Project Objective

The "Edit Karo" project aims to create a user-friendly mobile app for capturing and editing photos. Users can take new pictures or choose from their gallery, apply various filters and cropping tools, and save the enhanced images back to the gallery for easy sharing and storage.

## App Description and Functionality

"Edit Karo" simplifies photo editing with a range of powerful tools in a sleek, intuitive interface. Users can:

- **Capture or Select Images**: Use the camera or gallery to choose photos for editing.
- **Crop Images**: Adjust dimensions by zooming and confirming with a tick mark.
- **Apply Filters**: Choose from a variety of filters, apply them, and save the edited image to the gallery.

## Challenges

During development, several challenges were addressed:

- **Package Compatibility**: Resolved issues with outdated filter packages by updating or replacing them to ensure compatibility with new device operating systems.
- **Interface Integration**: Fine-tuned the transition between capturing and editing images, and optimized real-time processing to avoid lag.
- **Compilation Errors**: Addressed code compilation issues through systematic debugging and resolution of dependency conflicts.
- **Bug Fixing**: Identified and fixed unexpected bugs through extensive testing and iterative improvements.

These challenges were overcome with persistence and thorough problem-solving to deliver a robust, user-friendly photo editing app.

## Deployment

To deploy and run the "Edit Karo" app, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- For Android: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- For iOS: [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edit-karo.git
cd edit-karo

## Configure the Project

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up. Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env` and fill in the required values. This file might include API keys, database URLs, and other configuration settings.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. **Permissions**: For Android and iOS development, make sure that your app has the correct permissions set up to access the camera and gallery. These permissions should be configured in your `AndroidManifest.xml` (for Android) and `Info.plist` (for iOS).

3. **API Keys**: If your app uses third-party services, insert the required API keys into the `.env` file. Ensure these keys are kept secure and not hardcoded in the source code.

## Build the App

Once the project is configured, you can build the app for your target platform.

- **For Android**:

    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    ```

    This command will build the app and launch it on an Android emulator or a connected Android device.

- **For iOS**:

    ```bash
    npx react-native run-ios
    ```

    This command will build the app and launch it on an iOS simulator or a connected iOS device. Alternatively, you can use Xcode to build and run the app.

## Running the App

After building, start the app on your emulator or physical device. You should see the main interface of "Edit Karo," where you can capture new photos, select existing ones, apply filters, crop images, and save the edited photos.

## Additional Configuration

- **API Keys**: Double-check that all API keys and other sensitive information are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- **Permissions**: Ensure that your app has the necessary permissions for accessing the camera and gallery. You may need to adjust settings on your device or emulator to grant these permissions.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Issues**: If you encounter build errors, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](#) or file an issue in the repository for support.
- **Runtime Errors**: For runtime errors or unexpected behavior, check the app logs for detailed error messages and consult the [Common Issues](#) section for potential solutions.
