## Challenges

During development, several challenges were addressed:

- **Package Compatibility**: Resolved issues with outdated filter packages by updating or replacing them to ensure compatibility with new device operating systems.
- **Interface Integration**: Fine-tuned the transition between capturing and editing images, and optimized real-time processing to avoid lag.
- **Compilation Errors**: Addressed code compilation issues through systematic debugging and resolution of dependency conflicts.
- **Bug Fixing**: Identified and fixed unexpected bugs through extensive testing and iterative improvements.

These challenges were overcome with persistence and thorough problem-solving to deliver a robust, user-friendly photo editing app.
